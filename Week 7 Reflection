// JSON is in fact unknown territorry...
// Lalalalalala it doesn't exist (this will come to get me soon, I will lock in I promise)
// I tried using html for project 2 but it failed so miserably I will attempt it someday.. so the default sketch it is...
// Yes am I turning both my projects in? YEAH!!! My bad. I can't stop sleeping and then I forget I have things to do.
// I have also reached the point where I don't know my dates and don't know what I worked on this week (besides project 2)
// Going to start naming my projects properly #NewYearsResolution 
// Now I am even questioning if I am submitting the reflections correctly

// I lost count of most but I can kinda list what I used for inspo
//the amount of tabs i've had to sift through and those I closed are an abhorrent amount lol
