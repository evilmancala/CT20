// JSON is in fact unknown territorry...
// Lalalalalala it doesn't exist (this will come to get me soon, I will lock in I promise)
// I tried using html for project 2 but it failed so miserably I will attempt it someday.. so the default sketch it is...
// Yes am I turning both my projects in? YEAH!!! My bad. I can't stop sleeping and then I forget I have things to do.
// I have also reached the point where I don't know my dates and don't know what I worked on this week (besides project 2)
// Going to start naming my projects properly #NewYearsResolution 
// Now I am even questioning if I am submitting the reflections correctly
// Having to size all my files down was so tedious for Project 2 I wasted so much time
// I used a lot of YT and p5.js tutorials
// I lost count of most but I can kinda list what I used for inspo
//the amount of tabs i've had to sift through and those I closed are an abhorrent amount lol
//Also for some reason Project 2 on Github needs to be refreshed b4 viewing. Idk what happened but my bad

//Also for context on my project it's taken from the song The New Romans from the album Attention Shoppers by Nero's Day at Disneyland.
//Been a huge fan since I was like 10 so in proper weird kid fashion I have to dedicate at least one thing in my college career to NDAD
//NDAD is like 20 years old so unfortunately discontinued but the main artist Lauren Bousfield still makes muisc
// But ngl the color schemes are harder to make gradients plus I am the suckiest coder ever so I die
//Also yay Jerma mention... idk I needed dancing images and i only had so many already on my phone.
//ALSO ALSO i did use a music bar rather than click canvas to play bc it would loop to infinity and crash my laptop so I choose peace and love.
