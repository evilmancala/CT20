// Weaker more simple reflection for this week
// I kept spacing out and missing pieces of the lecture and haven't had time to look @ the video
// Therefore I have nothing to show for the week! Whoops!!!
// I will have to lock in this week though so there is light at the end of the tunnel...
// html is fun but I fear there are so many variables I do get lost
// off the top of my head I forget the order of <script>, <head>, <body>, etc.
// But hey, I remember the </> at the end so that is a plus. I feel like I would normally forget.
